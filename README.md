## BEFORE U INTERACT!!!




hi hello, im venus, but teddy also works! i am 18 and i use he/him and & it/its pronouns, im a gay and trans man. i likely have autism/adhd (probably both), so please be patient! i also misread things a lot, so if i make a mistake in reading something u say, please kindly correct me

INT!: same fandom, oomfs, doubles, pretty much any reason. i love talking to people! i can be awkward though, please forgive me ^^;

DNI: people under 15, proshippers, diehard vivziepop stans, country humans fans, smg4 fans (mr puzzles ponys get shot on sight), roleplayers (unless i have the roleplaying status on), and basic DNI criteria

  please do not make sexual jokes to or around me! it makes me very uncomfortable and i dont find it funny. if you dont stop i will just hide you
  
  also not rlly DNI material, but do not interact with me if you only want me/my pony to satisfy your fav ship/duo/whatever. i am a person! but if its a one off bit/joke its fine. i just am rlly uncomfortable roleplaying with strangers

inspo is fine! i love if a pony i make can help u make one of your own! but give it your own creative spin, get silly with it. please do not copy my ponies

feel free to ask me about how i do certain tricks/effects/etc on my ponies! i hate gatekeepers and i love the spread of information

ask for c + h pretty please. im kinda uncomfy with strangers getting that close to me out of nowhere (unless i have c + h in my user, then u can without asking)

im usually hanging around outside the cafe unless im dragged away by friends. feel free to come up and talk to me, i dont bite!
