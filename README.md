hi hello, im venus, but teddy also works! i am 18 and i use he/him and & it/its pronouns, im a gay and trans man. i likely have autism/adhd (probably both), so please be patient! i also misread things a lot, so if i make a mistake in reading something u say, please kindly correct me

DNI: people under 15, proshippers, diehard vivziepop stans, country humans fans, smg4 fans (mr puzzles ponys get shot on sight), alfreds playhouse fans, roleplayers (unless i have the roleplaying status on), and basic DNI criteria

  please do not make sexual jokes to or around me! it makes me very uncomfortable and i dont find it funny. if you dont stop i will just hide you

  i reclaim the F and T slurs, often in jokes around other queer people. if that upsets you, please tell me and i wont say them around you
  
  also not rlly DNI material, but do not interact with me if you only want me/my pony to satisfy your fav ship/duo/whatever. i am a person! but if its a one off bit/joke its fine. i just am rlly uncomfortable roleplaying with strangers

inspo is fine! i love if a pony i make can help u make one of your own! but give it your own creative spin, get silly with it. please do not copy my ponies

feel free to ask me about how i do certain tricks/effects/etc on my ponies! i hate gatekeepers and i love the spread of information

ask for c + h pretty please. im kinda uncomfy with strangers getting that close to me out of nowhere (unless i have c + h in my user, then u can without asking)

im usually hanging around outside the cafe unless im dragged away by friends. if im alone, im usually people watching. im rather awkward so give me some grace, but ill be chill if youre chill
